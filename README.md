# Mother Type

 Mother Type is an open-source type foundry exploring an open model for typefaces that are free to use, modify, and distribute under the SIL Open Font License (OFL). Our mission is to foster creativity and collaboration within the type community.

## About

Mother Type is an open-source type foundry.

We are committed to making type design more accessible, and all our typefaces are available for use, distribution, and collaboration via the SIL Open Font License (OFL). With this license, everyone is free to use, modify, and distribute our typefaces. We ask that you credit the designer and foundry when using our typefaces.

Our typefaces are shared and distributed via the Unified Font Repository. These repositories also serve as the Content Management System for this website. Change or update the typefaces repository, and the site will change with it. This site's main function is as a visual directory of updatable fonts, providing the user with the most up-to-date version of a typeface at any time, and hopefully, avenues for collaboration.

## Submissions

If you would like to submit a font, email us at [itsmothertype@gmail.com](mailto:itsmothertype@gmail.com), or make a fork of the Unified Font Repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/mother-type).
